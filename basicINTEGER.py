#in integer we can do increase or decrease example below
age = 19
age=age +1
print("AGE 1:",age)
print(type(age))

#more on easy way to do it 

age2 =20
age2+=1
print("AGE 2:",age2)
print(type(age2))

#so as you can see when i print the age with the string
#in int use " , " and in String use " + " 

#or you can do this code 
print("YOUR AGE: "+str(age2))
#and for basic and easy one use this
print("YOUR AGE :",age2)
